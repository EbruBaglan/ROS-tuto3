## 4.1.1.
1. Localization: determining the robot's pose in a mapped environment. done by implementing a probabilistic algorithm to filter noisy sensor measurements and track the robot's position and orientation.
4 very popular localization algorithms:
1. EKF: the most common Gaussian filter that helps in estimating the state of a nonlinear models.
2. Markov Localization: base filter localization algorithm. maintaind a probability distribution over the set of all possible position and orientation the robot might be located at.
3. Grid localization: histogram filter >> capable of estimating the robot's pose using grids
4. Monte Carlo localization: particle filter, estimates robots pose using particles

EKF and MCL: Monte Carlo localization.
